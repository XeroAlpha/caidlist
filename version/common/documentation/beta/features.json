Feature names can include a namespace of the form \"namespace:feature_name\" to help distinguish them from features that may be in other behavior packs. This namespace is not considered when matching the filename to the feature name. For example, in a file called \"my_tree_feature.json\" both \"my_tree_feature\" and \"my_pack_name:my_tree_feature\" would be valid identifiers. If two behavior packs define the same feature name (including namespace), then the feature from the highest pack in the stack will be used. This allows users to override base features if desired."
